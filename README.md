## Configuring VS Code Insiders to remotely run and debug

1. Follow [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) to enable paswordless ssh login  
Note that although Win10 has OpenSSH installed, it doesn't support the `ssh-copy-id` command. I found it easiest to do this all from a git bash shell

1. Then follow Hansleman's [instructions](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioCodeRemoteDevelopmentOverSSHToARaspberryPiIsButter.aspx) to set up VS Code (Insiders)
